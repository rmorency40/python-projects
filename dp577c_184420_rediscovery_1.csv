disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages

MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be

    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are

    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the

    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature

    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
